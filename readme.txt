== Description ==

It has been said that the majority of readers don't comment on blog posts because they don't feel like they have anything specific to add to a conversation.

This plugin allows you to prompt your readers to comment by asking them to answer a question specific to that post. A simple box with text that you define when writing your post is added above the comment form. The box can be styled to match your site by adjusting some predefined options.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `conversation-starter` folder and it's contents to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Modify the appearance of the prompt in Settings > Conversation Options
4. Add a prompt for each post in the "Add New" or "Edit" post screen

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I installed the plugin, but nothing happened. =

We didn't want to assume you wanted to prompt your users to say anything on every post, so we only put the prompts on posts where you've specifically entered a prompt. GO into the post edit screen and add prompts for users as you see fit.

== Screenshots ==

1. Custom Meta Box to enter your prompt
2. Options to change the appearance of the prompt
